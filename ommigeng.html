      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p>My name is Bobin Lilja, a systems administrator and Microsoft 365 specialist passionate about inclusive IT solutions. Since 2016, I have worked with support, operations, and cloud services—always focusing on the user experience. I grew up in a challenging environment where few believed in my ambitions, but through persistence and hard work, I proved you can go far.</p>
        <p>Throughout my career, I have implemented Intune solutions, configured Power Automate flows, and built internal service functions from scratch. I have experience leading projects in cross-functional teams and know how to create clear processes to maintain high quality.</p>
        <p>As a transgender woman, I understand the value of representation and actively work to increase inclusion in the tech industry. I live openly as pansexual and polyamorous, with honesty as the foundation of all my relationships. My ADHD has taught me to optimize workflows, and I use digital tools to structure both work and leisure time.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy single-player gaming, testing corporate IT systems, and creating outfits. I also love long road trips in my car while listening to audiobooks or my favorite music. My signature hat, along with my unique style, makes a lasting impression.</p>
        <p>I have previously been a volunteer with Stockholm Pride, where I have coordinated security and dispatch teams for several years.</p>
        <p>As a speaker, I enjoy discussing LGBTQ+ rights, diversity, and the role of technology in societal development, and I have also given internal company talks on inclusion.</p>
        <p>My work philosophy is built on continuous improvement, open collaboration, and active listening. I believe in building bridges between IT and other disciplines like HR to create holistic solutions, and I am interested in social and political issues so I can contribute to positive change.</p>
        <p>I have experience developing user support policies and documenting processes for long-term stability. I run a TikTok channel where I talk about being trans and inclusion, and I share insights on LinkedIn. I enjoy contributing to internal networks and discussion groups to share experiences and learn from others.</p>
        <p>I teach workshops on Microsoft 365, technology, and inclusion for colleagues and end users. I continually invest in my skills through courses and home lab experiments.</p>
        <p>Privately, I cherish quiet moments at home with family or a good conversation over coffee. My partner and I are currently exploring Gothenburg and discovering new favorite spots together.</p>
        <p>I am proud to have spoken at conferences about technology, diversity, and my personal journey. My vision for the future is to lead projects that combine technology, sustainability, and inclusion in society.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to discuss collaborations, ideas, or just chat about IT and life—get in touch for a coffee and conversation!</p>
